# Water Abundance Torus (WAT)

**Goal:** Permanent, non-enclosable water security run as a commons—not a utility to be captured.

---

## 0) Covenant (the containment field)

No crowns. No chains. Water is a commons, not a commodity.

**Copyleft for life:** Every design, bill of materials, control script and playbook licensed CC BY-NC-SA / GPL (no enclosure).

**Consent governance:** Users can enter/leave; decisions by Covenant of Equals (no shareholder override).

---

## 1) Input — What the community brings (not money)

**Local knowledge & maps:** Traditional sources, flood paths, dry wells, roof areas.

**Labor & craft:** Install crews, caretakers, sensor stewards, youth "water rangers."

**Sites & roofs:** Schools, temples, clinics, markets become catchment assets.

**Time & trust:** Timebank hours (ledgered) convert to "water credits" & maintenance priority.

**Data & observation:** Phone photos, well-depth logs, leak reports into an open ledger.

---

## 2) Circulation — Open tech + protocols (the OSIIN core)

### Modular tech stack (choose per climate; all open-source):

**Catch & store:**
- Roof-rain + first-flush
- Ferro-cement tanks
- Underground cisterns
- Fog nets in coastal hills
- Sand dams in ephemeral streams

**Lift & move:**
- Solar-PV pumps
- Gravity loops
- Pedal pumps
- Standard 24/48V DC bus so parts are interchangeable

**Make & clean:**
- Biosand/ceramic for pathogens (v1)
- UV-C / SODIS for low-power disinfection
- Membrane distillation with waste-heat/solar for brackish water (v2)
- Constructed wetlands & bio-reactors for greywater → irrigation
- Point-of-use filters as redundancy

**Recharge:**
- Percolation pits
- Infiltration trenches
- Check-dams to push water back into the aquifer

**Sensing & telemetry:**
- Cheap open hardware (ESP32/LoRa) on tanks, flow meters, well heads
- Publishes to OSIIN data hub

**Control & playbooks:**
- Open PLC/firmware + maintenance SOPs with photos/emoji ("schoolhouse manuals")

### Social protocols (the Resonance layer):

**Commons Guilds:** Pump Guild, Tank Guild, Wetland Guild—rotating, trained, paid in timebank credits + small stipends when available.

**Mutual credit:** Time → water credits; credits also redeemable for repair priority or seedlings.

**Open ledger:** Transparent dashboard shows inflows, outflows, leaks, downtime—no black boxes.

**Anti-capture deed:** Community water deed filed locally: infrastructure cannot be sold or pledged as collateral; if dissolved, assets revert to public trust.

---

## 3) Output — What returns to people (and why it sticks)

**Liters/person/day** at WHO sufficiency (≥50 L pppd) with <$0.01/L operating cost.

**Time back:** Hours/day saved (esp. women/children) from hauling water → converted to learning, care, micro-enterprise.

**Health uplift:** Drop in diarrheal disease, school attendance up, clinic visits for waterborne disease down.

**Green halo:** Neighborhood canopy increase, kitchen-garden yields, heat-island reduction.

---

## 4) Feedback — The regenerative loop (why it self-sustains)

**Live dashboards (schoolhouse simple):** Tank % full, well depth, leaks flagged, next service due. Kids read it in morning assembly.

**Incentives:** Leak bounties, "zero-downtime month" celebrations, timebank bonuses for preventive care.

**Adaptive design:** Sensor data → tweak catchment, pump duty cycles, filter replacement; OSIIN updates propagate like app releases.

**Replication packs:** Every successful node auto-generates a "clone kit" (BOM, cut lists, SOPs, costs, pitfalls) so neighbors can fork it.

---

## 📐 Pilot to Field: 6-step rollout

**1. Hearth audit (2 weeks):** Roof survey, source mapping, community workshop; pick 1 school + 1 clinic as anchors.

**2. Seed build (6–8 weeks):** Rain + storage + biosand + PV pump; install LoRa sensors; train the Pump Guild.

**3. Governance kick-off:** Adopt the Commons Creed; open the timebank; set leak bounty & maintenance rota.

**4. Greywater & gardens:** Wetlands at school/clinic, kitchen gardens; publish tutorial videos by local teens.

**5. Health & time baseline:** Simple metrics before/after; public wall poster of gains (no NGO PDF buried somewhere).

**6. Fork & scale:** Help a second neighborhood clone the kit; swap crews (cross-training); iterate licenses/handbooks.

## 🔎 Metrics that matter (resonance indicators)

**Access:**
- L/person/day
- % households > 50 L pppd
- Days of storage at 80% reliability

**Reliability:**
- Downtime hours/month per node
- Mean time to repair

**Equity:**
- Queue time variance
- Grievance resolution time
- % households contributing to guilds

**Health & life:**
- Diarrheal incidence
- School days missed
- Hours/day saved from hauling water

**Ecology:**
- Well depth trend
- Soil moisture
- Canopy index
- Wetland bio-scores

**Governance:**
- Number of trained guild members
- Rotations completed
- Audit trail completeness

## 🧬 Why this beats scarcity

**Anti-enclosure by design:** Copyleft + deed + transparency = privatization can't take root.

**Local first:** Parts you can fix with a wrench and a phone; standard DC bus, interchangeable modules.

**Human-centered ops:** Timebank + guilds turns "maintenance" into prestige + livelihood, not drudgery.

**Replication baked in:** Every node teaches the next; OSIIN propagates improvements like open-source software. next; OSIIN propagates improvements like open-source software.
